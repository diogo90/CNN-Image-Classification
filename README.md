# CNN Image Classification

Self-development project focused on gaining a practical understanding on how to deploy a CNN for binary classification. I am using tensorflow and a public healthcare dataset from Kaggle. This broadened my understanding on how to pre-process image data suitable for ingestion by a CNN and how to gradually fine tune and build a sequential CNN. Without great lengths, the notebook explains the reasoning behind the chosen steps for: data pre-processing, image augmentation and CNN training. I am also leveraging the computational power of Google Colab to deploy and train algorithms. Aside from the technical implementation it allowed me to get the hang on developing a solution that can support healthcare professionals.
